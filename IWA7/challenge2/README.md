# Interactive Web Apps JavaScript Fundamentals
## IWA_7 Challenge 2
The following code should log a message that says Good morning with a dynamically entered name (from two possible variables).  

Either a nickname and/or firstname can be added as variables in the code. If a nickname is present it should be displayed instead of the firstname, if there is no nickname then the firstname should be shown. Unfortunately, currently, the following gets logged: Good morning, ${nickname} || {firstname}!.  

Please change the expression, in the console log, to behave correctly, and explain why it did not behave as expected. Furthermore, please add a state that when neither a firstname nor nickname is present only Good morning! should be logged.
### original script
```javascript
const nickname= "Timmy";
const firstname = "Timothy";

console.log("Good Morning, ${nickname} || {firstname}!")
```
### Pathway to fix code

## What changes did you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?

## Why did the change result in the intended behaviour?

## Are there any other ways in which it could have been solved?
